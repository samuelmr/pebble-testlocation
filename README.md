Usage
-----
You can test if your Pebble can get your current location or track your movement. 

If you select "Watch position", the watch display is updated whenever your phone registers your movement. You can stop the location watcher by pressing the SELECT button.

The user interface may be a bit sluggish sometimes. Please give your watch some time to react to your commands.
